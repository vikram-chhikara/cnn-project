    :alt: Latest Version

Requirements
------------
Aside from Python 3 and those packages specified in
`setup.py <https://github.com/lebedov/python-pdfbox/blob/master/setup.py>`_,
python-pdfbox requires ``java`` to be present in the system path.

Installation
------------
The package may be installed as follows: ::

    pip install python-pdfbox

One may specify the location of the PDFBox jar file via the ``PDFBOX``
environmental variable. If not set, python-pdfbox looks for the jar file
in the platform-specific user cache directory and automatically downloads
and caches it if not present.

Usage
-----
The interface currently exposes the text extraction feature of PDFBox only: ::

    import pdfbox
    p = pdfbox.PDFBox()
    text = p.extract_text('/path/to/my_file.pdf')

Development
-----------
The latest release of the package may be obtained from
